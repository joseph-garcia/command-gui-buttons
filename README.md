# Command GUI Buttons

Command GUI Buttons is a fabric mod for Minecraft that allows users to create custom command buttons on their clients. Users can bring up this menu in-game with the G key, type in the Name and Command they want to create a button for, and press the + to create. It will then show up as a button on their screen to use whenever they want, as the button will automatically type and execute the command they initially entered.

Create buttons for preset chat messages, commands like '/warp home', or anything else that goes in the chat box.

## How to Use:

  - Bring up the menu in-game with the G key
  - Type in the Name and Command you want to save into a button
  - Press the + button



### How It Works
The list of commands are serialized into a JSON format and stored locally on the usersâ€™ systems. The mod writes any new commands into the JSON as new buttons are created, and loads the JSON at the start of the game. A local list instance exists for reading and loading the buttons each time, so that file reading is kept to a minimum.
